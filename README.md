The hackathon topic was only one word: *health* and teams have full freedom of choice of technology and solved issue.
Our tool supporting physical activities during breaks at work with computer. When employee accept the reminder and calibration is done, program uses webcam to detect the paddles
and display points which user should reach. This cause user have a break with physical activity.
